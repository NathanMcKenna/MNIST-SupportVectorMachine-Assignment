Support Vector Machines

This is a previously completed homework assignment that I have chosen to upload to github because it demonstrates my implementation of a SVM on a common testing dataset. Please view my analysis of the project and results in the SVManalysis_NathanMcKenna.pdf file located in the repo. The MNIST dataset will need to be unpickled for use because it is too large to be stored uncompressed on GitHub.com


Overview
--------

In this homework you'll explore the primal and dual representations of support
vector machines, as well as explore the performance of various kernels while 
classifying handwritten digits.
